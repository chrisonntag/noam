# Noam

This is a simple Web Extension, which opens saved URLs in a separate browser window. I'm using this as a replacement for apps like Rambox or Franz which are basically just regular browsers – safes a lot of memory and overhead.

Add services under ```about:addons > Preferences``` and open the 'ChatWindow' by clicking on the Noam icon in the toolbar.
